# Organisational Blog

## Why

We are creating blog to showcase our work on the FAC course to the world. Constructing the site will enable us to dive into the deep, bad world of HTML and CSS and hopefully learn loads along the way.

## What

Our blog will consist of several components

- We will have a landing page where we will have a brief introduction to our group and what the purpose of the blog will be.
- We will each have individual profile pages, where all our contact information will be found.

- We will priorotise our sites accessibility so that it is available to everyone.

- We will make sure that our site is responsive so that it can be accessible from as many devices as possible.

- Aesthetics are very important to us so the site will be as pretty as possible.

## How

We will research different technologies to try to implement the many cool ideas we have thought up in our wireframe diagrams.
